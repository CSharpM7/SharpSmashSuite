(Beta window will only contain Renaming and Exporting panel)

## Installation

### SharpSmashSuite.py

This can be installed in two main ways:

Single file:  
Open the scripting tab in blender, in the text editor click on the open file icon and select the python script. Then click on the run button

Add-on:  
Go into Edit > Preferences, go to the add on tab and click on Install. Select the python script and then check the box next to the addon's name.

### export\_obj.py

This is a patch file for the object exporter in Blender to make it compatible with the Suite. Normally, blender formats obj meshes like "objectname+objectmesh". This py script makes it so it only includes the object's name. Place it in your Blender's io\_scene\_obj folder, it might be located here:

C:\\Program Files\\Blender Foundation\\Blender 2.93\\2.93\\scripts\\addons\\io\_scene\_obj

**HOW TO USE**
1. You'll want to build this repo from source:
https://github.com/jam1garner/nutexb
(You'll need rust on your local machine, and then run cargo build from the root folder)
2. You'll be given a `target` folder. Navigate to `target/debug`
3. Copy the contents of that folder here. In this folder you should have `nutexb_cli.exe`
4. There should be a new checkbox on the batchimg2nutexb gui program
5. This should help with converting DDS files without having large file sizes

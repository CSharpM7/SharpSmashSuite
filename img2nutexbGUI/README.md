GUI interface for jam1garner's [img2nutexb program](https://github.com/jam1garner/img2nutexb) (place the program in this directory)

Supports conversion of entire folders and a restricted set number of files.

## Usage

After retrieving a list of textures from Blender SSS, copy and paste the texture list into the right text window. If doing this manually, only insert the filename + extension, not the full file path. Set the directory to search files for, and the directory to place the newly create nutexb files in. This creates several nutexb files to be used with StudioSB and CrossMod

# Steve Spec

Lets you view and edit block boundaries for Steve on most stages


## Prerequisites
You'll need:
- ArcExplorer, as well as a dump of the `/stage/common/shared/param/` folder
- Parcel for creating patches of the `groundconfig.prc` file for each of your mods
- Yamlvd to automatically retrieve Camera Boundary info, or StudioSB to find out the boundaries for your stage

## Usage

When booting for the first time, the program will ask you to located ArcExplorer and Parcel. Afterwords, it will ask for the workspace for your mod. This program will also remember the last used workspace on launch.

# Lazy Config

Creates a config.json for use with acropolis. Note: this only works for stages, not for characters

## Usage

This is intended to be used on SDcards, or workspaces that are set up similarly to SDcards. (They should have a stage folder, and inside there should be normal/model/...)

Open the program, it will prompt you to select a folder named "stages". This will generate a json folder and proceed to open the location where it is saved in file explorer. For your convenience, the program will also remember the last place you saved a config file to make the process slightly faster when iterating

## Getting Started

Each folder in the repo has a README.md to look at that serves as a quick overview of the program. Additionally, the wiki will be updated regularly with additional topics on the Blender plugin

# Workflow

### High Level:

Our end goal is to be able to quickly prototype stage designs through the use of Blender and Python. To do this, we'll need to export models, create a list of materials and textures to build a numatb file, and manipulate a numdlb file so that we can automatically assign materials to meshes.

### Step By Step Overview:

1.  Blender SSS - Prepare your models. This blender program can properly separate objects by material, group objects by material without losing UV maps, rename meshes to their material's name, and export a list of material and texture names
2.  LazyMat - Create a numatb file. You'll use the exported material list to fill this out. This can be customized to keep a list of shaders.
3.  Img2nutexbGUI - Convert several images at once to nutexb files
4.  StudioSB - Import your meshes from Blender, export a numdlb file
5.  LazyNumdlb - Reassigns meshs' their material label based on that mesh's name. This only works if Blender SSS was used on the mesh
6.  CrossMod - After using LazyMat, LazyNumdlb, and StudioSB, Â preview the model
7.  LazyConfig - Creates a config.json to be used with file addition
